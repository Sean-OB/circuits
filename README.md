Analyzes simple circuits

Note: So far the main functionality of the program is to detect simple shapes in ta given circuit. By calling find_all on the address of an image file, the program will detect these shapes and draw them in red on a copy of the image before displaying it.

Updates to come:
- Shape objects will be analyzed as circuit elements
- Electronic circuit schematics will be generated from said circuit elements
- Algorithmic analysis of the circuit nodes will yield numeric or symbolic values for the voltage/current of each circuit node and element
