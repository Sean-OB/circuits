Goals of the program, in decending order of importance:

1. Given a set of element nodes with some known values, calculate the rest of the values of each node or determine that it is not possible given the input.
2. Construct a set of element nodes from an electronic diagram of the circuit.
3. Construct a set of element nodes from a hand-drawn diagram of the circuit.
4. Construct an electronic diagram of the circuit from a set of element nodes. (Can be used to output results from #1)
5. If no exact solution can be reached, include a symbolic expression for nodal values in terms of each other.
6. Include op-amps and capacitors in the system.

Rules for the construction of the nodal graph analysis program:

1. All elements have some input voltage, output voltage, resistance and current at any given point in time.
2. One wire element must be marked as "ground"; its voltages will be set to zero.
3. The nodes will be traversed in arbitrary direction beginning at the ground wire, which will be the "base case" for node traversal.
4. All currents will be converted to positive values with corresponding directions in the final output.

(For development)
Possible strategies:

Steps to final program:
	1. Recognition: Convert hand-written diagram to electronic diagram
	2. Abstraction: Convert electronic diagram to nodal graph elements in python
	3. Calculation: Symbolically find expressions for each nodal value
	4. Output: Reconstruct the electronic diagram and label with values

Abstraction
### TO DO ###
	Detect each element on the graph (store original position for future display)

Calculation
	Starting from the ground node, recursively traverse the circuit and add each previous node as inputs

Output
